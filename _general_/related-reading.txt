# General Language Criticism

## Using symbols rather than words makes a language more difficult to learn

Example in ClojureScript code

(def my-js-obj #js{:foo "bar"})
(.log js/console my-js-object)

What does that `#js{}` do? Is that JavaScript interoperation?
How would I find this in the syntax documentation?
https://cljs.github.io/api/syntax/

Nope! Thats an object literal.
https://cljs.github.io/api/syntax/tagged-literal

Example in Ruby documentation

https://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Array.html

Look at the list of methods on the left. Some start with `::` but most start with `#`.
What's the difference? Why don't you have to use the # when calling functions?

Example in PHP documentation

http://php.net/manual/en/function.preg-replace.php

What is up with the `[]` around some parameters.
Why does the last parameter have a `&` in front of it?

There is also ReasonML which I didn't get to for this presentation,
but appears to be a language that wants to sit alongside your existing JavaScript
code base as much as possible, making a competitor to PureScript and TypeScript.
It claims you can leverage the OCaml and JavaScript ecosystems at the same time.
ReasonML was created by Facebook.
